# Eternal Support

Eternal-Support is a support library, which adds useful functions and requests to libraries such as nekos.life and akaneko, its objective is the optimization of work resources

## Utilities

Obtaining anime images through akane√±o and nekos.life _Example:_

### Anime Images

```js
import { mobileWallpapers } from 'eternal-support';
async function getMobileWallpapers() {
  const mobileWallpapers = await mobileWallpapers();
  console.log(mobileWallpapers);
}

getMobileWallpapers();
```

### Console Style

```js
import { logWithLabel } from 'eternal-support';
logWithLabel('info', 'Hello World');
```

## Installation

```bash
npm install eternal-support
```

## Types of requests

I added a typings file and will be working to improve it. This allows editors like VSC to use *intellisense/autocomplete* to suggest functions and help out with parameters and to see what you'll be receiving as a result of function calls.
